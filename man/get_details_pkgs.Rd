\title{Get details about installed packages}
\usage{
get_details_pkgs(
  pkgs = character(0),
  lib.loc = NULL,
  priority = NULL,
  fields = c("Additional_repositories", "Repository", "SystemRequirements", "URL")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pkgs}{A character vector with names of packages to be checked, or
ending in such names, see \code{Details}.}

\item{lib.loc}{
    character vector describing the location of \R library trees to
    search through, or \code{NULL} for all known trees
    (see \code{\link{.libPaths}}).
  }

\item{priority}{
    character vector or \code{NULL} (default).  If non-null, used to
    select packages; \code{"high"} is equivalent to
    \code{c("base", "recommended")}.  To select all packages without an
    assigned priority use \code{priority = NA_character_}.
  }

\item{fields}{a character vector giving the fields to extract from
    each package's \file{DESCRIPTION} file in addition to the default
    ones, or \code{NULL} (default).  Unavailable fields result in
    \code{NA} values.}
}
\value{
A matrix containing the details of the installed packages. If \code{pkgs} has a
length larger than zero, only information about the packages in \code{pkgs} is
returned. A zero-row matrix is returned if no packages were found, with a
warning.
}
\description{
Wrapper around \code{\link[utils:installed.packages]{utils::installed.packages()}} to get more information about
the origin of packages and select the packages for which to return
information.
}
\details{
The part after the last forward or backward slash is considered to be the
package name if input to \code{pkgs} contains such slashes. Therefore the package
name, the file path to packages, and the full URL to packages from
\href{https://github.com/}{GitHub} can all be used as input to \code{pkgs}.

Packages are looked for in the library paths given by \code{\link[=.libPaths]{.libPaths()}}.
}
\section{Notes}{

All instances are returned if a package occurs more than once, with a
warning reporting their version, library path and origin.
}

\section{Programming notes}{

Could improve speed by using \code{\link[=find.package]{find.package()}} if \code{pkgs} is not \code{NULL}? See
the \verb{Programming notes} of \code{\link[=check_pkgs]{check_pkgs()}}.
